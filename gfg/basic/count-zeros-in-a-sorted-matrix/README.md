# Count zeros in a sorted matrix

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a  **n * n** binary Square Matrix where each row and column of the matrix is sorted in ascending order. Find the total number of  **zeros**  present in the matrix.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: mat[][] = [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,1]]
 
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The first, second and third row contains 3, 2 and 1
zeroes respectively.
```

```
Input: mat[][] = [[1,1], [1,1]]
 
Output: 0
Explanation:
There are no zeroes in any of the rows.
```

 **Constraints** 
0 < n ≤ 103
0 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 1

```java
class Solution {
    public int countZeros(int[][] mat) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < mat.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < mat[i].length; j++) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
